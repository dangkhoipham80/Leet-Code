## 🌳 Repository Structure

### 📂 Organization by Branch

Each programming language is organized on a **separate branch** for easy management and tracking:

| 💻 Language | 🌿 Branch | 📊 Status |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Python** | `python` | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Active-success) |
| **Java** | `java` | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Active-success) |
| **C++** | `cpp` | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Active-success) |
| **JavaScript** | `javascript` | ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Active-success) |
| **Go** | `golang` | ![Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Planned-yellow) |
| **Rust** | `rust` | ![Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Planned-yellow) |

> ⚠️ **Note:** The `main` branch serves as a **landing page only** - no solution code here!

## 🌟 Tips for Beginners

<details>
<summary><b>👉 Click to see tips</b></summary>

### 1️⃣ Start with Easy
Don't rush into Hard problems. Master Easy first.

### 2️⃣ Understand before coding
Read carefully, draw diagrams, test manually before coding.

### 3️⃣ Analyze Complexity
Always ask: What's the Time O(?) and Space O(?) of this solution?

### 4️⃣ Learn from other solutions
After AC, read others' solutions to learn new approaches.

### 5️⃣ Consistency > Intensity
1 problem/day is better than 10 problems/week then quit.
